	<p class="paragraph1">A year before SpaceX was founded, Elon had some money from his first projects PayPal and Zip2 
	then he wanted to put money into a project that would reinspire the country to go to space again.
	In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse
	containing seeds with dehydrated gel on Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, "so this would be the 
	furthest that life's ever traveled" in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and 
	increase the budget of NASA. But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to 
	Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology. </p>
	
	<p> In Early 2002 Musk actually went to Moscow with his two friends to meet with ISC Kosmotras about
	purchasing 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) for his experiment. The group met with Kosmotras,
	and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by Musk as too expensive and Musk 
	left the meeting. While on the return flight Musk realized realized it would be cheaper for him to start
	a company to build his own rockets, and design them to be re-usable.  A metaphor Elon would frequently 
	use with us is comparing it to throwing away a Boeing 747 after every flight. We simply can't go forward 
	in space exploration if the vehicles don't become reusable. </p>

	<p>According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials
	for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. </p>
	
	<p> By applying vertical integration (the degree to which a company carries out the different stages in an 
	industrial orcommercial process, rather than depending on outside
	suppliers and customers) principally for cost reasons; around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon vehicle is 
	produced in-houseand the modular approach from software engineering SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor
	of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. Another reason for vertical integration was Musk's belief 
	that reusable rockets could not be built with components from existing aerospace suppliers. For example, 
	SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld aluminium-lithium alloy for the airframe of 
	the Falcon 9 because such a machine did not exist. According to Musk SpaceX started with the smallest useful 
	orbital rocket instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and 
	bankrupted the company. </p>
